"""This module provides objects and functions to write genes to the mirror and to check the validity of the genes.

Variables:
PCI_BOARDS -- The NI addresses for the PCI boards
ACTUATOR_ADDRESSES -- The addresses for the various actuators within the PCI board

Classes:
actuator_array() -- This maps all of the neighboring actuator pairs (including diagonal actuators)
and makes sure the voltage differences aren't too high

Functions:
array_conversion() -- maps the 37 genes to the correct actuators
send_to_board() -- sends two arrays of voltages to the two PCI boards
write_to_mirror() -- organizes genes and makes sure they will not break the mirror
