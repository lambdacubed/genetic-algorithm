Initialization properties for IC cameras (note 1: not all of these properties are available for each camera), (note 2: you can enter "auto" for the setting to automatically be controlled or "none" if you don't want to set that value), (note 3: these properties are copied from cam.list_property_names() from the pyicic library. If those change, these should change as well.), (note 4: the lines must be double spaced and have an information line at the beginning. The first variable must appear on line 2)
